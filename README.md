# VASD
 VASD is a research project to improve the process of designing non-linear audio for games. Multiple mockups, prototypes and experiments will serve to further investigate how to develop a tool that improves this process.

## Rookery
All experiments get applied to project Rookery, a currently being developed game. Prototypes will include a link with the application of the prototype to the project.
