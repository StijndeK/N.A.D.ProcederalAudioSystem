# VASD
VASD is a research project to improve the process of designing non-linear audio for games. Mockups, prototypes and experiments will serve to further investigate a tool that improves this process.

## Current status
The latest version is [Experiment6](https://github.com/StijndeK/VASD/tree/master/2_VisualOverviewAnd1dparameters(C*)/VASD_EXP6), which offers a 2d grid to test non-linear audio looping.

## Application to games
Experiments are applied to multiple projects are currently being developed. Prototypes include a link containing a video of the application of the prototype to the project:
