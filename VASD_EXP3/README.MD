# EXP3
```diff
- In progress
```

The third VASD prototype. EXP3 builds further on the system created in [EXP2](https://github.com/StijndeK/VASD/tree/master/VASD_EXP2_PY). 
This versions main focus will be on adding external parameters for audio to adapt to and adding play percentage functionalities.

### Unity + FMOD API
Because of the need for more complex features and the eventual application of VASD on games, EXP3 is build in Unity using the [FMOD Core API](https://fmod.com/resources/documentation-api?version=2.0&page=core-guide.html). The FMOD API allows for the ability to keep prototyping relatively quickly with certain game-specific functionalities easily available. Unity allows for quicker prototyping, especially for the visual 2d interface. I do want to eventually port the program to C++ for maximal optimisation and to for example apply it to UE4.
