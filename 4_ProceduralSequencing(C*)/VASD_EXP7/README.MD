# EXP7
The seventh VASD prototype. The goal for EXP7 is to use a different approach for a more procedural sequencing system, to apply to Procedural Imagination, a interactive procedural environment game. A less visual approach allows me to be quicker to implement the audio into the game. EXP7 also uses a less unity object component based approach, so that the script will be easier to part to different workspaces/languages.

Currently under development.
